# Ordering Color

My senior capstone project demonstrating different algorithms 
and their uses in ordering color. 

## Description
Both RGB and HSV colorspaces can be understood as a three-dimensional plane with 
colors existing as points. Values r, g, b and h, s, v can be understood as x, y, z
coordinates. This opens up the possibility of using the nearest neighbor algorithm,
as well as using space-filling curves such as the z-order curve and Hilbert curve, 
to order color. These graph-based solutions can be compared to more naive 
implementations of color ordering, such as using quicksort to order on individual
values.

## Requirements
Visual Studio

The code is written in C# and is available to be download and run through the
Visual Studio IDE that it was written in.
