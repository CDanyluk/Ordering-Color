# Ordering-Color
My senior capstone project demonstrating different algorithms and their uses in ordering color.

Independantly written by Chantal Danyluk

Goals of this project include independantly exploring a new programming language, C#, building a sufficient program 
that allows for visible color sorting, and exploring different algorithms.
